Call Of Duty 2025 Will Be Black Ops 2 Sequel - Report

Call of Duty will apparently be back in Black Ops for the next two entries. A new report claims that the 2025 installment for the FPS franchise will be a Black Ops 2 sequel set in the year 2030. What's intriguing about the dates (on top of Mason being obsessed with the numbers) is that the 2012 game had, at the time, a futuristic 2025 storyline.

Insider Gaming talked to multiple sources about the Black Ops 2 sequel, which is reportedly codenamed Saturn. The original intent was for this 2025 game to only feature remade multiplayer maps from Black Ops 2, but supposedly now the idea is to mix these old locations with totally new arenas. The change might be because of bad feedback to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 only offering remakes of maps from 2009's Modern Warfare 2 at launch.

Call of Duty 2025 is still roughly two years away from release, so specifics could obviously be altered. But for the time being, Insider Gaming says the Black Ops 2 sequel is expected to have a rebuilt movement system, Pick-10 customization for multiplayer, and round-based Zombies.

Meanwhile, Call of Duty 2024 is reportedly a Black Ops title focusing on the Gulf War and set in the 1990s. This game--which hasn't officially been unveiled--will apparently feature old maps, too. A leak suggested the game would see the return of WMD from Black Ops and Grind from Black Ops 2. However, it may be the case where the latter is now attached to 2025's Call of Duty instead.

In October, Activison revealed that Call of Duty has been mapped out through 2027.
